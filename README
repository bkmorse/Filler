Add the file: pi.filler.php into a new folder called: filler

the folder needs to be placed within:

system/expressionengine/third_party/

so you'll have:

system/expressionengine/third_party/filler/pi.filler.php

Usage:

{exp:filler channel="test_channel" status="open" total="10"}
 text and/or html goes here
{/exp:filler}

channel, status (only one) and total are all required.

If your channel only has 6 entries and you need 10 spots filled, you would set total to 10, and it would add the extra 4 entries
